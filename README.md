# Rules

Type hints should be provided for the maintainability of the code. Turn on strict type checking in whatever IDE you are using. If some third party packages doesn't support type checking very well, then you can write `# type: ignore` to suppress the warning.

# Command line scripts

Install packages written in `requirements.txt` from PYPI

```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```
